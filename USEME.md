# USEME â€” ImageProcessing

## To Run

In the terminal, navigate to the root directory. Then to run the script, run:
```
java -jar ImageProcessing.jar res/script.txt
```
---
To run the full program to the console, run:
```
java -jar ImageProcessing.jar
```
and enter commands into the console.

---
Alternatively, run the main() method of **ImageProcessor**, and enter commands into the console.

### Sample Script:
```
# load square image into the processor
load res/square.ppm square

# create the red component greyscale of the square image
red-component square squareRed

# create the value component greyscale of the square image
value-component square squareValue

# create the horintally flipped version of the value component greyscale of the square image
horizontal-flip squareValue squareValueHorizontal

# create the brightened by 50 version of the red component greyscale image of the square
brighten squareRed squareRedBright 50

# create the blur of the square image
blur square squareBlur

# create the sharpen of the square image
sharpen square squareSharpen

# create the greyscale of the square image
greyscale square squareGreyscale

# create the sepiaTone of the square image
sepiaTone square squareSepiaTone

# save all of the new images
save squareRed res/square-red-grayscale.ppm
save squareValue res/square-value.ppm
save squareValueHorizontal res/square-horizontal.ppm
save squareRedBright res/squarebrighten-by50ppm.ppm
save squareBlur res/square-blur.ppm
save squareSharpen res/square-sharpen.ppm
save squareGreyscale res/square-greyscale.ppm
save squareSepiaTone res/square-sepia-tone.ppm
save squareBlur res/square.bmp
save squareBlur res/square.png
save squareBlur res/square.jpeg
